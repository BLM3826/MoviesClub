~ In attempts for a better name ~


### Public info:
This full-stack project is an awesome non-professional academic work of two upcoming programmers, a website about movies.     
It works on localhost and local DBs.
After running it with Springboot you can access the site and do stuff like:
* Search Movies by title
* Click a movie for more details
* Create an account
* Keep bookmarked movies in your account
* Access your bookmarks

All movie data used from OmdbAPI
